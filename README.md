# Untitled-Pokemon-Romhack

## What is a "ROM hack"?
* "ROM hacking is the process of modifying a ROM image or ROM file to alter the contents contained within, usually of a video game to alter the game's graphics, dialogue, levels, gameplay, and/or other elements" -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROM_hacking.
    * This project is a fork of the existing ROM hack: https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion.
* This untitled ROM hack uses a series of base modifications of the original 'Pokemon Emerald' game ROM (made by the above project) as foundations for further modifications made by me.

## Overview
* Changes I have made on top of these base modifications include:
    * The roots of a completely original storyline to the game.
        * As part of a new storyline, the addition of these things are inherent:
            * New 'trainer battles'.
            * New 'wild pokemon' spawn locations.
    * The start of my own new in-game 'region' (the larger area in which the entire game is played - something that is inherently integral to all Pokemon games, not just ROM hacks), including original designs of new individual location 'maps'.
    * The introduction of a new tileset not used by the original game.
* In order to implement my own changes, I have had to use various programming languages and pieces of software:
    * the C programming language.
    * the 'poryscript' programming language (a custom language for more easily adding certain in-game events to ROM hacks than with C).
    * the 'porymap' software for editing the in-game world/map.

## Current status
* I don't plan on continuing with the project anytime soon.
* The game / ROM hack is in a playable state, but is quite short.
* I may continue with the project at some point or another later on but, for now, it will remain as it is.
